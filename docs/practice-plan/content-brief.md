## Authoring Requirements

- Each project needs 6 activities conforming to the standard flow (Warm-up → Anatomy → Guided Draft → Tool Choice → Applied Challenge → Retro).
- Provide ≥12 scenario shells per track at launch so parametric items can rotate contexts.
- Target difficulty bands:
  - Foundation (levels 1–2 projects #1–2)
  - Core (levels 2–3 mid projects)
  - Challenge (last project per track + boss assessments)
- Ensure at least one Prompt Surgery and one Tool Selection activity per project.

## Assessment Alignment

- **Level 1 Assessment** will pull from Track 1 warm-up + guided drafts.
- **Level 2 Assessment** draws from Tracks 2 & 3 applied challenges.
- **Level 3 Assessment** combines Track 3 & 4 high-difficulty items, weighted toward planning/evaluation/safety.
