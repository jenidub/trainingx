Create a web-based quiz application based on a provided JSON configuration and question structure. The quiz has 25-35 multiple-choice questions, divided into sections (Intro, AI Skills, Cognitive Skills, Readiness Signals). Customize the quiz dynamically based on user inputs (age, tech level, goals) collected at the start. Adjust tone, wording, and question difficulty as follows: for users under 15, use fun, story-like phrasing (e.g., "AI as a superhero"); for users 26+, use professional tone (e.g., "vibe coding" as "prompt-based development"); for familiar/pro tech users (if not under 15 and goal interest ≥2 points), add 3-5 harder questions (e.g., tool-specific like Cursor/Replit scenarios) to aim for 20-30% incorrect answers, encouraging platform use for growth. Ensure no more than 4-6 path variations.

Score answers (0-10 points per question, ~100 total) and use the algorithm: IF Risk≥10 AND (AI≥25 OR Cognitive≥28) → Entrepreneur; ELSE IF Structure≥10 AND Cognitive≥30 → Career; ELSE IF Time≥10 AND AI≥20 → Side Hustle; ELSE → Early Stage. Adjust paths by age/tech (e.g., under 15 gets fun modules, non-tech gets extra guides). Output results as a personalized "AI Readiness Level" with TrainingX course recommendations. Include a JSON object to manage customizations (triggers for age/tech, path modifiers).

Features:
- Display one question at a time with radio/checkbox inputs (based on "choose one" or "up to two").
- Show progress (e.g., "Question 5/25").
- Store user answers and compute scores.
- At the end, show score, path, and tailored course suggestions.
- Email results (mock an API call or form).
- Keep UI clean, mobile-friendly, and engaging (5-12 min completion).
- Handle dynamic question injection/removal based on intro answers.
- Use the provided JSON for customization logic:
