Based on your answers:

If under 15: We swap in fun, story-like Qs (e.g., "Imagine AI as a superhero...").
If 26+: Tone shifts to professional – less "vibe," more "effective strategy."
If familiar/pro (3-4 pts) AND not under 15 AND goal/interest shows engagement (2+ pts total): We add 3-5 harder Qs in AI sections (e.g., tool-specific like Cursor or Replit scenarios) to challenge without overwhelming – aim for ~20-30% wrong to highlight growth areas.
Keeps variations light: Core quiz same, just 10% tweaks for feel/scoring.
