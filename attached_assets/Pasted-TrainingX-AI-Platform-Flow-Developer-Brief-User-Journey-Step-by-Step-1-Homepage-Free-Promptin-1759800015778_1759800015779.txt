TrainingX.AI Platform Flow (Developer Brief)
User Journey (Step-by-Step)
1. Homepage → Free Prompting Aptitude Assessment

Third-Party App Cards (Learning how to prompt external tools):
Each card represents a major AI usecase (coding, image generation, studying, teaching, creative, vidoe gen, etc etc)
Card Structure:
* Preview thumbnail — shows the tool interface
* Three tabs inside each card:
    1. Bad Prompt — example that fails (with explanation)
    2. Almost Prompt — example that's close but not quite right
    3. Good Prompt — winning example (with breakdown of why it works)
* Skills Tag — shows which prompting skills this tool teaches (e.g., specificity, context-setting, format control)
Goal: Users learn how to prompt every major AI tool on the market by comparing bad/good examples.

* System matches their prompting abilities to:
    * Job openings (requiring AI/prompt skills)
