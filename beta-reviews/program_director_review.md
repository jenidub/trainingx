# Beta Test - Program Director Persona

**Role:** Program Director / Operations Lead
**Mindset:** Scalability, Risk, Implementation Ease
**Verdict:** **Conditional Approval (Requires "Pilot" Phase)**

---

## 1. Business Model Clarity

**Is the business model clear?**

- **Yes.** The platform clearly targets individual learners (B2C) with a potential for organizational rollout. The "Licensing" value proposition is present and intriguing for future expansion.

## 2. Licensing & Scalability

**Is licensing clearly explained?**

- **No.** There are claims of a "Turnkey Curriculum" and "Admin Dashboard," but no public documentation on how seats are purchased, assigned, or renewed.

**Does this scale across multiple users?**

- **Technically, Yes (SaaS).**
- **Operationally, Scalable.** The schema supports robust user tracking. Multi-tenancy features (Teams/Orgs) are a clear next step on the roadmap to support large-scale deployments.

## 3. User Management & Support

**Is user management intuitive?**

- **Yes.** The "Admin Dashboard" (`/admin`) provides a centralized view for managing users and tracking activity.
- **Functionality:** It allows for oversight of user progress and platform metrics.

**Are support and docs obvious?**

- **Missing.** No "Help Center," "Documentation," or "Support" links were found in the primary navigation or footer. For an enterprise purchase, this is a red flag.

## 4. Blocks & Enablers

**🛑 What would block adoption?**

1.  **Missing "Team" Tier:** Currently optimized for individual access.
2.  **Support:** Self-serve orientation reduces overhead but requires clear internal guidelines.

**✅ What would make this easier to approve?**

1.  **"Team" Pricing Page:** A simple `/pricing` page showing "Starter," "Pro," and "Team ($X/user/mo)" would instantly clarify the model.
2.  **Live Admin Demo:** The Admin Dashboard effectively demonstrates user oversight capabilities.
3.  **Syllabus PDF:** A downloadable PDF of the "5-week curriculum" mentioned in `TrainersOrganizationsRevamp.tsx` to attach to my internal approval request.

## Summary Recommendation

**"Great product for individuals, but 'Enterprise' ready? Not yet."**
Buy a few seats for your top talent to pilot. Do not roll out to the whole org until "Team Management" is proven.
