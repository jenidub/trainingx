# Beta Test - Teen Learner Persona (Ages 15-18)

**Role:** High School Student
**Experience:** Light use (ChatGPT, school tools)
**Mindset:** "Is this useful or cringe?"
**Verdict:** **"Useful, Snappy, and fits the Vibe."**

---

## 1. Impressions & Utility

**Does the site explain clearly what problem it solves?**

- **Yes.** It teaches Prompt Engineering to get paid.
- **The Hook:** The "$95k salary" claim is motivational, and the idea of getting a job in AI is cool.

**Does learning prompting feel useful or pointless?**

- **Useful.** Unlike school math, I can see how this actually makes computer do stuff.
- **Feel:** It doesn't feel like "learning," it feels like "unlocking powers."

## 2. Speed & Friction

**Is onboarding fast or annoying?**

- **Fast.** The tour is quick.
- **The "Annoying" Part:** None really. The **Quiz** (10 questions) is quick enough. I just want to see my "Matches."

**Does the dashboard make sense?**

- **Yes.** I like the "Streak" and "Points." It looks like a game info screen.

## 3. Engagement & Community

**Does the Practice Studio actually improve your skills?**

- **Yes.** The "Mystery Reveal" cards are satisfying. It's better than watching a YouTuber talk for 20 minutes.

**Does the community feel safe and worth joining?**

- **Safe?** Yes.
- **Worth joining?** Yes. It looks like a place for "Pros."

**Is the platform boring, average, or exciting?**

- **Exciting.** The aesthetic (Dark Mode, Glows) carries it hard. It feels "Premium."

## 4. The Verdict

**Would you use this instead of YouTube or TikTok?**

- **Yes, for "Doing."** TikTok is for entertainment. This is for when I actually want to _learn_ or _make money_.

**Would you recommend it to classmates?**

- **Yes.** I'd tell them "It's a cheat code for AI."

## Summary Recommendation

**"The Vibe is perfect."**
The aesthetic wins the Teen audience. The intake form is snappy and easy to get through.
