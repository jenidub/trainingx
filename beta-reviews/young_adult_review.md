# Beta Test - Young Adult Beginner (Ages 18-25)

**Role:** College Student / Early Career
**Experience:** Moderate (uses AI for papers/work)
**Mindset:** Value-Driven, "Show me the ROI"
**Verdict:** **"High Potential, Value is Clear."**

---

## 1. Value & Speed

**Is the value proposition clear immediately?**

- **Yes.** "Certified Prompt Engineer" = Better Job. That is clear.
- **Setup Process:** Fast and smooth. No credit card required upfront is a huge plus.

**Does the setup process feel smooth or frustrating?**

- **Smooth.** The "One-click" start is good.

## 2. Learning Quality

**Does the prompt learning section actually teach skill?**

- **Yes.** The "Fix this prompt" challenges are actual skills. It's not just theory readings. I feel like I learned something after 5 minutes.

**Does the Practice Studio feel practical or gimmicky?**

- **Practical.** It focuses on _iteration_ (improving a prompt), which is the real skill.

## 3. Missing Features (The Dealbreakers)

**Is the AI database useful?**

- **YES.** The "AI Database" link works perfectly and shows relevant opportunities. It's a great resource for finding "Vibecoding" jobs.

## 4. The Verdict

**Would you pay for this?**

- **Not yet.** It feels like a "Beta." I would pay $10 once, but not a subscription yet.

**What feels missing?**

- **Deep Dives.** The "Vibecoding" concept is cool, but I want to see _advanced_ examples. Show me how this helps me code a website or write a thesis faster.

## 5. Project Arcade (New Feature)

**"Finally, the Portfolio Builder."**

- **Reaction:** **"This is the ROI I was looking for."**
- **Why?** The "Standard Practice" was good for drills, but Arcade is good for **Resumes**. Building an "AI E-commerce Store" or "SaaS Landing Page" is something I can actually show a recruiter.
- **The "Starter Prompt":** It's a massive time-saver. It gives me the "80%" so I can focus on the "20%" (polishing and deploying).
- **Request:** Keep the "Business/Tool" projects coming. Don't let it become _just_ games. I need to build "Real Apps."

---

## Summary Recommendation

**"Great core, and Arcade seals the deal."**
The core "Gym" is great for skills, and **Project Arcade** is the "Capstone" that solves my "Deep Dive" request. The active "AI Database" adds real professional value for a savvy young adult.
