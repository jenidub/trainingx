# Branding & Aesthetic Review

**Verdict:** **It looks great.**

It feels like a "Pro" tool, not a boring school website.

## 1. The Vibe (Dark vs Light)

- **Landing Page:** It’s dark, glowy, and looks futuristic. It grabs your attention.
- **Dashboard:** It switches to a clean, light theme. It feels like an actual workspace where you get things done.
- **Is the switch jarring?** **No.** The dashboard background is a soft "Off-White" instead of blinding bright white. It feels smooth.

## 2. Colors & Style

- **The "Teal/Blue":** The main color makes it look techy and modern.
- **The "Glass" Effect:** The see-through cards make it look expensive/high-quality.
- **Consistency:** The buttons and fonts match everywhere. It doesn't look like two different websites pasted together.

## 3. Visual Proof

**It passes the eye test.**
