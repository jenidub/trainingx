## 1. First Impressions (The 10-Second Test)

**Do you understand what this platform is?**

- **Kind of.** I see "Vibecoding" and it looks cool. It looks like a spaceship interface.
- **Am I confused?** A little bit. I don't know what "Prompt Engineering" means, but the button says "Start Training" so I know I'm supposed to click that.

**Do the colors feel fun and safe?**

- **Yes!** It’s dark mode with glowing blue and green lights. It looks like a "Pro" gamer setup. It’s definitely not "scary" or "boring workspace" colors.

## 2. Navigation & Experience

**Do you know what to click next?**

- **Yes.** The big button that glows. And the "Tour" thing showed me where to go.
- **The "Orb" (Spiral):** I like the floating circle thing. It looks like an AI from a movie. I want to talk to it.

**Does it feel made for your age?**

- **Mostly.** "Vibecoding" sounds like something my friends would say.

## 3. Learning by Doing ("Vibecoding")

**Does the practice studio help?**

- **Yes.** I like clicking the cards to see what's underneath (Mystery Reveal). It satisfies my brain.
- **Is it homework?** No. Homework is reading a PDF. This is pressing buttons and getting points. I like getting points.

**Is anything confusing or boring?**

- **Confusing:** None.
- **Boring:** If there's too much reading before I can click a button, I might tab out to YouTube.

## 4. The Friend Test

**Would you come back tomorrow?**

- **Yes,** to keep my "Streak" going. I don't want to lose my fire emoji 🔥.

**Would you tell a friend?**

- **Yes.** I'd say "Check out this site, it teaches you how to hack AI and it looks distinct."
- **Why?** Because it makes me look smart using it.

## Summary Recommendation

**"Keep the game vibes, hide the business words."**
For kids my age, focus on the "Leveling Up" and "Badges." We don't care about the job market yet, we care about being the best at "Vibecoding."
