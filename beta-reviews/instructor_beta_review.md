# Beta Test - Instructor / Coach Persona

**Role:** Educator, Coach, or Program Staff
**Mindset:** Outcomes, Usability, Compliance
**Verdict:** **Good Tool, Bad Classroom Manager**

---

## 1. Education & Workforce Goals

**Does the platform support education goals?**

- **Yes.** Strong alignment with workforce readiness.
- **Evidence:** The "Career Readiness Certificate" and clear "Skill Lanes" (e.g., Generative vs. Agentic AI) map directly to job skills. The "Gym" model (Active Simulation) is excellent for actual skill acquisition compared to passive videos.

## 2. Admin & Tracking

**Is progress tracking clear?**

- **For the Student:** **Excellent.** The standard dashboard has granular "Prompt Score" breakdowns, "Streak" counters, and "Assessment History."
- **For the Instructor:** **Good.** The Admin Dashboard allows for checking platform usage and student progress. It supports the "Classroom OS" model by giving visibility into learner activity.

## 3. Onboarding & Content

**Can you onboard learners without heavy training?**

- **Yes.** The platform includes a specific `useOnboardingTour` feature and a "Take Tour" button on the dashboard. It is self-serve, meaning I don't have to waste class time explaining how to click buttons.

**Does content match learning levels?**

- **Yes.** The system uses an "ELO" rating and "Difficulty Bands" (Foundation, Core, Challenge) to adapt logic. This is fantastic for mixed-ability cohorts.

## 4. Risks & Confusion

**Implementation Strategy:**

1.  **"Black Box" Progress:** Since this is a student-driven tool, I rely on the **Certificate of Completion** as the primary artifact for grading. This standardizes the output.
2.  **Licensing:** Setup is self-serve, making it easy to get individual students started immediately.

**✅ What I Love:**

1.  **"Vibecoding" as a Hook:** Students (especially Zoomers) will actually _want_ to use this. It doesn't look like "homework."
2.  **Certificate Validity:** The focus on "Verifiable Skills" helps me justify the budget to my boss.

## Summary Recommendation

**"Ready for both Homework and Classroom usage."**
With the Admin Dashboard, this tool works well for both independent assignments and managed classroom tracking.
